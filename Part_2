Google Data Analytics Capstone Project - Part 2 

Summary:

This report summarizes the second part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone Project, focusing on the analysis of Divvy bike-sharing data from 2019 and 2020.

Analysis Methods:

Part 2(a):

Data Source: Full 2019 and 2020 datasets

Tools: SQL for data cleaning and transformation, Tableau for visualization

Challenges:
Difficulty with data transformation using ALTER TABLE in SQLite.
Manual adjustment of date formats in CSV files for compatibility with Tableau.
Defaulted Tableau joins linking years instead of specific dates.

Outcome: Visualization depicting trip start stations, trip counts, and subscriber counts for 2019 and 2020.

Part 2(b):

Data Source: Divvy_Trips_2019_Q1 and Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1 datasets

Tools: R Posit Cloud, R Script, ggplot2

Challenges:
Limited data volume in R Posit Cloud necessitating clear row definition during export.

Outcome: Comparison plots of trip duration and day of the week for 2019 and 2020.

Conclusions:

Both analysis methods offer insights into Divvy bike usage patterns.
Identification of stations with high subscriber activity can guide targeted marketing efforts.
Further exploration of the full 2019 and 2020 datasets can reveal seasonal trends and user behavior nuances.

Recommendations:

Explore advanced data transformation techniques, such as Python scripts, for handling complex datasets.
Delve deeper into user demographics and trip duration analysis for additional insights.
Refine marketing strategies based on identified high-activity stations and user segments.
